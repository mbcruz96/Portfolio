# Education
- M.S., Computer Science | University of Central Florida (_May 2024_)
- B.S., Computer Science | Florida State  (_December 2021_)


# Work Experience
**Application Systems Analyst @ Leon County Government (_March 2022 - January 2023_)**
- We manage large, distributed applications used by the DSEM and contractors, as well as all the data associated with said applications. 
- One of our largest systems, Accela, manages Building, Environmental Management, Developmental Services, code compliance, and many other types of permits for construction. 
- We manage all end points of the permitting and construction process. We configure the applications we manage based on the business practices of our vendors and the DSEM via scripts.

**Level II Call Agent @ Department of Children and Families (_June 2020 – November 2020_)**
- Worked as a Level 2 Agent for DCF, assisting people with different financial assistance and welfare programs.
- Advocated on behalf of clients to identify appropriate social and medical benefits based on economic parameters.
- This position was temporary due to high demand resulting from the coronavirus.

**Cheerleading and Tumbling Coach @ Freedom Athletics (_May 2017 – December 2018_)**
- Worked as a Tumbling Coach, taught individuals ranging from ages 3-18 tumbling and stunting skills to better their cheerleading potential.
- Conditioned the athletes to increase their fitness level. Worked in teams, ensuring proper safety techniques were enforced. 


# Research
**Comparative Study of Facial Detection Algorithms**
- Researched Haars Cascade, MTCNN, Dlib, DNN, RetinaFace, and HOG facial detection algorithms in efforts to compare their performances.
- Implemented all algorithms in three mediums: photos, videos, and live-stream videos.
- Goal: To determine the performance of currently used facial detection algorithms, highlighting the benefits and limitations of each in different situations

**Clinical Report Generator**
- Created a Transformer with a CNN encoder and an LSTM decoder to automatically generate clinical reports.
- After training multiple models, the model weights were averaged using Federated Learning to create a global model and propagated the weights back to each individual model.
- By utilizing a federated learning, the model could be upscaled so that hospitals could use the model to generate clinical reports without sharing private patient information across hospitals.
- Goal: To implement a model that would allow medical data to be used in deep learning models without breaching constraints imposed by HIPPA

# Projects
### [Canny Edge Detector](https://github.com/mbcruz96/Canny-Edge-Detection.git)
- Implemented the Canny Edge Detector
- Images are smoothed using a Gaussian filter and then their orientations and magnitudes are calculated.
- Non-maximum suppression is performed on the image pixels to discover true edge pixels.
- Using hysterisis thresholding, dominant edge pixels are discovered using eight way connectivity. 
- [Code](https://github.com/mbcruz96/Canny-Edge-Detection.git)

**[Digit AutoEncoder](https://github.com/mbcruz96/AutoEncoder)**
- Using the MNIST dataset, an autoencoder model was implemented that predicts what digit a photo contains
- The model encodes the image into a latent space and decodes a representation of the original image with upsampling
- [Code](https://github.com/mbcruz96/AutoEncoder)

**Otsu Thresholding**
- Implemented the Otsu thresholding algorithm for binary image segmantation
- This implementation iteratively uses each pixel intensity from 0-255 to calculate the intra class variance between the two distributions created by using the current pixel intensity as the seperating boundary of the distributions.
- The intensity which yields the highest variance amongst the distributions is chosen as the thresholding value used to alter the original image.
- [Code](https://github.com/mbcruz96/Otsu)

**Generative Shakespearian Speech Model**
- NLP model that generates text in the style of Shakesperian english
- The model is pretrained on a corpus containing some of Shakespear's work
- Using a seed, the model generatively creates sentances reminiscent of old English vernacular
- [Code](https://github.com/mbcruz96/LSTM/blob/main/TextGenerator.ipynb)
  
**MCTL template library**
- Created the Michael Cruz template library, which implements some of the data structures available in the C++ std library.
- [Code](https://github.com/mbcruz96/MCTL.git)
